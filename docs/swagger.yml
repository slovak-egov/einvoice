        JWT token satisfying:
        - encoded by RS256 algorithm
        - signed by your private key (paired with public key you set in your account)
        - `sub` claim set to your user Id as a string
        - `exp` claim set to current UTC timestamp + 30 minutes
        - `jti` claim set to random string unique during 60 minutes

        Example of `header` segment:

            {
              "alg": "RS256",
              "type": "JWT"
            }

        Example of `payload` segment:

            {
              "sub": "1",
              "exp": 1607590024,
              "jti": "4dee8618-abbe-4dc3-83ba-e984d1396f9f"
            }

        Notes:

        - `jti` value should follow regular expression `/\A[0-9a-z\-_]{32,256}\z/i`
        - same `jti` value cannot be reused in 60 minute timeframe
        - server considers `exp` valid if it fits in time interval `(current UTC; current UTC + 30 minutes)`
